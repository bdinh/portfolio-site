# Bao Dinh's Personal Portfolio

This repository contains code for my personal portfolio. The process of creating my 
portfolio took 4 days. 2 days was used to create and establish a stable design that
visually captures everything I wanted in a portfolio. 2 days was used to actually implement 
the design. Although my portfolio visually has all of the components that I had originally 
envisioned, I have made changes since and those changes will be flushed out as I find more time
to implement my ideas. Within the repository, you can view my journaling of the process as well 
as my initial designs for the portfolio.
